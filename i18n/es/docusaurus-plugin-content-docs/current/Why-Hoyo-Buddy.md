# Why Hoyo Buddy?

## Introduction

There are numerous Hoyoverse-related Discord bots on the market, so why choose Hoyo Buddy? What makes Hoyo Buddy stand out from the others, including the ones you might already be using?

## It Combines Everything

Hoyo Buddy is designed from the ground up to support all (current and future) Hoyoverse games. With Hoyo Buddy's multi-account system, you only need one bot to manage all your accounts and access all features. Additionally, if you have multiple accounts for the same game, you can access them all with a single command.

## It's Free

Hoyo Buddy is completely free. We understand the frustration when developers lock fundamental features (like custom art for character build cards) behind a paywall, essentially forcing you to pay. That's why we never lock any features behind a paywall. Everything on Hoyo Buddy is free â€” there are no "premium" features or perks.

## It's Easy to Use

The user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) of our commands have been thoroughly tested to ensure they are intuitive. Additionally, the bot is easy to start with, as we have polished our account setup process, so all the necessary steps are explained clearly to help you start enjoying Hoyo Buddy's features as fast as possible.

## It's Visually Appealing

Hoyo Buddy's designs are beautiful. An aesthetic design can make your day, and when you share your cards with friends, you want them to look impressive, not dull or bland. At Hoyo Buddy, we understand this, which is why we strive to create the best designs for the bot's commands. Plus, to reduce eye strain, Hoyo Buddy includes a dark theme switch for all its designs. With Hoyo Buddy, you can enjoy the perfect combination of beauty, speed, and user-friendly features.

## It's Open-Sourced

Hoyo Buddy's entire codebase is open-sourced on GitHub, and you are currently viewing this article in Hoyo Buddy's repository. Being open-sourced means you can see exactly how the bot handles your data. This transparency is crucial for Hoyoverse Discord bots because they interact with your account data. Unlike many other bots on the market, the open-sourced nature of Hoyo Buddy makes it possible to view how the bot is utilizing your data, in turn reducing security concerns.
