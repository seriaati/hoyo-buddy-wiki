# Fixing "Too Many Requests" Error When Adding Accounts

## What's Happening

This error is usually temporary. Wait 30 minutes and try again. If the error continues, your account may be "soft-locked" (one user reported their account unlocked automatically after 5 days).

## Important Don'ts

1. DO NOT reset your password - this makes the problem worse
2. STOP trying to login with email/username and password (on HoYoLAB, Hoyo Buddy, or in-game)

## Solutions Based on Your Situation

### If You're Still Logged Into Your Games (Genshin, ZZZ, etc.)

1. Contact customer service (see email template below)
2. Try these workarounds for Hoyo Buddy:
   - Use DevTools method (available next to email & password option)
   - Try logging in with email instead of username (or vice versa)

### If You're Not Logged Into Your Games

#### If Your Account Is Linked to Social Media (Google, X, etc.)

1. Login to your games using the linked social media
2. Contact customer service
3. Try the workarounds above for Hoyo Buddy

#### If Your Account Is Not Linked to Social Media

Check if you can log in to the [Hoyoverse Account Center](https://account.hoyoverse.com/):

- If YES:
  1. Link your account to a social media platform
  2. Login to your games using that social media
  3. Contact customer service
  4. Try the workarounds for Hoyo Buddy

- If NO:
  1. Try logging in with email instead of username (or vice versa)
  2. If that doesn't work, contact customer service and wait for their response
  3. Unfortunately, you won't be able to access your game account until this is resolved

## Workaround Details

### Using Email Instead of Username (or Vice Versa)

Some users found that switching between username and email for login can bypass the error message. If you've been using your username, try your email instead (and vice versa).

### Using DevTools Method

If you have a PC or laptop, you can use the DevTools login method (button is next to email & password option). Note: You won't be able to use code redemption features with this method.
