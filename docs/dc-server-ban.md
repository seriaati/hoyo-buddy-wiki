# Usage in Discord Servers

## What Can Get You Warned or Banned

Some users have received warnings for discussing Hoyo Buddy or sharing its content in **Official Discord servers**.

At this time, only official servers are known to restrict Hoyo Buddy use. Other Discord servers may have different rules - check with server admins to be sure.

These actions **will** trigger warnings in Official Discord servers:

- Talking about Hoyo Buddy
- Sharing content made by Hoyo Buddy:
  - Definitely banned: Build cards and character summary cards
  - Possibly banned: End game cards and other content
- Using Hoyo Buddy in a server where it's not allowed

Remember: Multiple warnings can lead to a ban.

## Why Official Servers Ban Hoyo Buddy

The official reason is that Hoyo Buddy is a third-party service that violates Hoyoverse's Terms of Service. Hoyoverse considers it a security risk.

Unofficially, Hoyoverse may see Hoyo Buddy as competition that makes HoYoLAB less relevant.

## What About Unofficial Discord Servers?

We haven't seen unofficial Discord servers ban Hoyo Buddy yet. If any do, it's likely because they're following Hoyoverse's Terms of Service rules.

## Will This Affect My Game Account?

Most likely not. Bans from official Discord servers should only affect your Discord access and shouldn't impact your game account in any way.
