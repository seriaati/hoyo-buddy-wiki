# Account Pre-Setup Guide

:::note

If you already have a Hoyoverse account, you can skip this guide and go to [Getting Started](./Getting-Started.md).

Setting up a Hoyoverse account is only needed if you want to login with the email and password method. If you wish to login with DevTools, you can skip this guide. [Which login method should I use?](./FAQ.md#which-login-method-should-i-use)

## I Login With 3rd-Party Services

"3rd-party services" refer to Google, Apple, Facebook, X, etc.

First, go to [HoYoverse Account Center](https://account.hoyoverse.com).

Click "Log In" and choose the third-party provider you use to login to your game.

After logging in, 3 things can happen:

### Link a New Account

![Third-party Account Linking](../src/assets/images/hb-account/web/sign-up_google-link.png)

This means that the email you used to login is not linked to any Hoyoverse account. Enter a desired password and click "Link", this will create a new Hoyoverse account and bind it to the third-party login you used.

You can then use this email and password to login to Hoyo Buddy.

### Link Email

![Link Email](../src/assets/images/hb-account/web/link-email.png)

This means that a Hoyoverse account was created automatically when you logged in with the third-party provider. Click "Link".

![Password and Security](../src/assets/images/hb-account/web/password-and-security.png)

On the next screen, click "Manage" in the "Password and Security" section.

![Update Password](../src/assets/images/hb-account/web/update-password.png)

Click on "Update" and follow the instructions to set a password for your account.

You can then use this email and password to login to Hoyo Buddy.

### Link to an Existing Account

![Link to Existing Account](../src/assets/images/hb-account/web/link-existing.png)

This means a Hoyoverse account with the same email already exists. Enter the password of this Hoyoverse account and click "Link" to bind the third-party login to the existing account. If you forgot the password, click "Having problems?" -> "Forgot Password?" to reset it.

You can then use this email and password to login to Hoyo Buddy.

### Password Last Updated Date is "-"

Follow the same steps as [Link Email](#link-email) to set a password for your account.

### Other Scenarios
