# Account got Hacked

This section explains how someone can hack your Hoyoverse account.

See [Account Security](./Account-Security.md) for information on how Hoyo Buddy works and how your data is stored securely.

## How Accounts Get Stolen

To steal a Hoyoverse account, someone needs to:

1. Have your Hoyoverse email & password to log into the account center (cookies are NOT enough)
2. Request to change your email address (which requires verification from your original email)
3. Access your email account to get the verification code
4. Change your account email to their own
5. After this, they control your account because password resets go to their email

## What Probably Happened

1. Your Hoyoverse account had a weak password that was easy to guess or crack
2. Your email account also had a weak password (or worse, used the same password)
3. You're using an email service with limited security features (unlike services like Google that require additional verification)
4. Your device might be infected with malware that stole your login information

## What You Should Do Now

1. Change all your passwords immediately
2. Check your email account for suspicious login activity
3. Use unique and strong passwords for different services
4. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possible
5. Scan your devices for malware
